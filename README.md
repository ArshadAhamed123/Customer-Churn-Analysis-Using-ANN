ðŸ“ˆ Churn Analysis Using Telecom Dataset
Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using a telecom dataset from Kaggle.
I implemented an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model built with Keras (TensorFlow backend) and achieved an accuracy of 77%.

Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major concern for telecom companies. Identifying customers likely to leave can help companies take proactive measures to retain them.
The goal of this project is to build a model that accurately predicts whether a customer will churn based on various features.

Technologies Used :
Python, TensorFlow / Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization), Kaggle (dataset source)

Results
Final ANN model achieved an accuracy of 77% on the test set.

Key features impacting churn: MonthlyCharges, tenure, Contract Type, and TotalCharges.
